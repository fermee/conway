React exercise

- 'game of life' as described by Conway

Goals of exercise:
- create my first React project that does something interesting...
- create React functional components with a level of dynamic sizing (e.g. the width x height)
- using React state (lift state where appropriate)
- using React hooks
- understanding 2D (nested Array) javascript with state (deep copy of objects/arrays)
- using CSS to change appearance

To do:
- ability to edit and created initial board (currently always random)
- separate "action" from background: this could be used to define objects like a glider and move/copy them with the mouse.
- save/load edited or calculate board
- improve speed / memory usage
- when initializing, the number of live cells still displayed as 0
- more responsive layout: change dimensions of the grid based on viewport/device

This runs "ok" in development mode but really needs to be build for production to see a reasonable speed
Even at full speed n production build it sometimes chokes a fraction of a second.
