React exercise

- Created 'game of live' as described by Conway

Goals of exercise:
- create React functional components
- using React state (lift state)
- using React hooks
- understanding 2D JavaScript matrix (nested Array) with state (deep copy of objects/arrays)
- using CSS to change appearance

This runs ok in development mode but really needs to be build for production to see a reasonable speed!
